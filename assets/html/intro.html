SDKs are currently under development -- so far we have:<br>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StitchCredit/b2c-api-javascript" target="_blank">_javascript_</a>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StitchCredit/b2c-api-python" target="_blank">_python_</a>
</ol>
<p>Before you start: </p>
<ul>
<li>We provide you with a host configuration for our development server and a demo user's identity in a postman environment.
<li>To quickly grasp the token flow and sequence of API calls, download and import the "Getting Started" postman collections from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VU0awRVnOswE1e9srB_tJ7nBxqUZFN2-?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> and the postman environment we provided to you.
  <ul>
  <li>Additionally, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VU0awRVnOswE1e9srB_tJ7nBxqUZFN2-?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> contains a postman collection for each API.
  </ul>
<li>Equifax end-points are accessible by first using the User API <strong>/users/efx-config</strong> response data, and then the Equifax <strong>/oauth/token</strong> call.
<li><strong>User API</strong> and <strong>Equifax API</strong> calls are intended to be called from the end-client/user's device. 
<li>It is not acceptable to pass any of the data to these calls or responses from these calls to your server.
<li>Do not save any data. Short term caching is fine, but long-term storage is not.
<li>Keep in mind, the preauth token is only valid for 30 seconds.
<li><em><strong>Direct API</strong> calls must originate from your server</em>
<li><em><strong>User API</strong> calls must originate from the end-client</em>
<li><em><strong>Equifax API</strong> calls must originate from the end-client</em>
</ul>
